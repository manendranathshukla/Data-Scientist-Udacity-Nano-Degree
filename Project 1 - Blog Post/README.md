### Introduction
In this project, I did the analysis for Effectiveness of STD Drug. This is dataset which I took from their hacker earth platform from a machine learning challenge [link](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-std-drug-effectiveness/problems/). This data contains nearly 32,165 responses. I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in the `Project 1 - A Blog post.ipynb` file.

For this analysis, I focused in answering these three questions:

1. What are the top 10 most effective drug according to patient rating ?
2. How the use case of drug is distributed among different diseases ?
3. Which drugs have more no of prescription ?
